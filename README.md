# 🌌 Whipsmart.nvim

Whipsmart.nvim is a modular, native-first Neovim configuration built on top of the Neovim 0.12+ `vim.pack` system. It evolved from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) into a modular, machine-aware "Grand Unified" configuration.

## ✨ Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Plugin configurations are isolated in `lua/plugins/*.lua`.
- **Native-First**: Leverages Neovim 0.12's built-in `vim.pack` for plugin management and native LSP/Autocomplete improvements.
- **Runtime-Aware LSP**: Automatically detects available language runtimes (Go, Node, Python) and only installs corresponding LSP tools, preventing errors on minimal systems.
- **Ergonomic Dashboard**: Includes `pack-manager.nvim` to provide a polished, Lazy-like UI on top of native primitives.
- **Machine Awareness**: Per-machine overrides live in a gitignored `lua/local.lua`, loaded last so it can override any default — no machine-specific code in the tracked config.
- **Version Pinning**: Uses `nvim-pack-lock.json` for reproducible environments across all your hardware.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you are running **Neovim 0.12+** (nightly or latest stable). You will also need:
- `git`, `make`, `unzip`, `gcc`
- `tree-sitter-cli` (Arch: `pacman -S tree-sitter-cli` | Others: `cargo install tree-sitter-cli`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (recommended)

### 2. Installation

```sh
# Clone your fork (replace <your_username> with your GitHub handle)
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/whipsmart.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim

# Start Neovim — plugins install automatically on first launch
nvim
```

On first launch, Mason will install the default LSP servers and formatters for the runtimes it detects on your system (e.g., Go, Node.js, Python). Once complete, verify your environment:

```vim
:checkhealth whipsmart
```

> **Tip:** Whipsmart is "runtime-aware." If you install a new language later (e.g., via `mise` or `asdf`), **restart Neovim** to pick up the corresponding tools automatically — runtime detection runs once at startup, so `:MasonToolsInstall` alone will not notice the new language.

### 3. Set Up This Machine

Machine-specific settings go in `lua/local.lua`, which is **gitignored** — it never gets committed, so each machine keeps its own. Start from the example:

```sh
cp ~/.config/nvim/lua/local.lua.example ~/.config/nvim/lua/local.lua
```

It is loaded at the very end of Section 1 in `init.lua`, after every default is set, so anything in it wins:

```lua
-- lua/local.lua
vim.g.have_nerd_font = false                          -- terminal without a Nerd Font
vim.g.whipsmart_colorscheme = 'tokyonight-night'      -- 'tokyonight-*' or 'catppuccin-*'
vim.o.scrolloff = 15                                  -- big monitor
vim.g.loaded_python3_provider = nil                   -- re-enable the Python provider (off by default)
vim.g.python3_host_prog = '/usr/local/bin/python3'   -- ...using an interpreter with pynvim
vim.g.disabled_lsp_servers = { 'lua_ls' }             -- skip on low-resource machines
```

See `lua/local.lua.example` for the full annotated list.

**Opt-in extras are the exception** — enable those from a file in `lua/custom/plugins/`, not here. `local.lua` runs in Section 1, before the core plugins load, so an extra that depends on blink.cmp or LSP (the `markdown` one does) will fail:

```lua
-- lua/custom/plugins/debug.lua
require 'whipsmart.plugins.debug'
```

> **Note:** `init.lua` does have a hostname block, but it is empty by design. Prefer `local.lua` — putting overrides in `init.lua` commits one machine's settings to every machine.

## 🛠️ Package Management

Whipsmart provides two ways to manage your plugins:

### The "Lazy" Way (High-Level UI)
Press **`<leader>pm`** to open the **Package Manager Menu**. This dashboard allows you to:
- Check for updates
- Install new plugins
- Disable/Enable existing plugins
- Clean up unused packages

### The "Native" Way (Low-Level Access)
Whipsmart also exposes the raw `vim.pack` primitives:
- **`<leader>ps`**: **Sync** (`vim.pack.update()` — move plugins to the newest revision matching
  each spec's `version`, then rewrite the lockfile).
- **`<leader>pr`**: **Restore** (`vim.pack.update(nil, { target = 'lockfile' })` — move plugins to
  the revisions recorded in the lockfile. Use after pulling this config on another machine — in a
  Neovim started *after* the pull, see below — or to revert a bad update).
- **`<leader>pi`**: **Inspect** (View current plugin status offline).
- **`:lua vim.pack.del { 'name' }`**: Remove a plugin from disk and from the lockfile. Removing a
  plugin's config leaves it on disk as *inactive* — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) under *Removing a
  plugin* for how to list orphans before deleting them. This only cleans the current machine; to
  drop a plugin everywhere, also add its name to `lua/whipsmart/pack_removed.lua`.
- **`:w`**: Inside the update buffer, write to disk to apply changes. Then `:restart` to load the
  new plugin code.

Inside the update buffer, `gra` offers per-plugin code actions (update / skip / delete), `K` shows
details for the change under the cursor, `gO` lists the buffer structure, and `]]` / `[[` jump
between plugin sections.

### 🔒 Managing `nvim-pack-lock.json` Across Machines
Whipsmart tracks `nvim-pack-lock.json` to ensure reproducible environments. When you update plugins locally, the lockfile changes should be committed and pushed to keep all your machines in sync.

When pulling changes from upstream:
- If you have local lockfile changes you want to keep, commit them first before pulling.
- If you want to discard your local lockfile updates and accept the remote version:
```sh
git restore nvim-pack-lock.json
git pull
```

After pulling a lockfile someone else updated, **quit or `:restart` every running Neovim first**, then
run **`<leader>pr`** — not `<leader>ps`, which would fetch the newest revisions and overwrite the
lockfile you just pulled. Neovim reads the lockfile once per session, so a session that was open
during the pull would restore the old revisions and write them back over the ones you pulled.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full details on managing lockfile workflows and resolving conflicts.

## 💻 Customization

### Adding a Personal Plugin
Drop a `.lua` file in `lua/custom/plugins/` — it is loaded automatically on startup and will never conflict with upstream changes.

Example `lua/custom/plugins/harpoon.lua`:
```lua
vim.pack.add { 'https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon' }
require('harpoon').setup {}
```

### Adding a Core Plugin
To add a plugin to the core `lua/plugins/` layer, create the file and then register it in the explicit loader list in `init.lua` (Section 2):

```lua
for _, mod in ipairs {
  ...
  'plugins.my_new_plugin',  -- add here
} do
```

### Adding LSP Servers
LSP configuration lives in `lua/plugins/lsp.lua`. Add **one row** to `lsp_servers` — the Mason install list, the runtime gate, the opt-out filter and the post-install retry are all derived from it:

```lua
local lsp_servers = {
  lua_ls = {
    mason = 'lua-language-server',   -- Mason name for lua_ls
    config = { ... },                -- passed to vim.lsp.config
  },
  basedpyright = { mason = 'basedpyright', runtime = 'python', config = {} },
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| key | **lspconfig name** — passed to `vim.lsp.config` / `vim.lsp.enable` |
| `mason` | **Mason registry name** — passed to `mason-tool-installer` |
| `runtime` | key into the `runtimes` table; omit when the server needs no language runtime |
| `config` | the server's `vim.lsp.config` table |

A server is installed **and** enabled only when its `runtime` is on `PATH` and neither of its names is in `vim.g.disabled_lsp_servers`. A runtime counts as available when **any** of its binaries is found, which is how `node` accepts npm/pnpm/yarn/bun.

Mason packages that aren't language servers — formatters, linters, and rust-analyzer (driven by rustaceanvim) — go in `extra_tools` instead, using the same `runtime` keys.

> **Note:** lspconfig names and Mason names often differ. Look up the correct Mason name at [mason-registry](https://mason-registry.dev/registry/list) and the lspconfig name in the [lspconfig server list](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/configs.md).

### Format-on-Save
Format-on-save is **on for every filetype** — there is nothing to opt into. `lua/plugins/format.lua` sets:

```lua
format_on_save = { timeout_ms = 1000, lsp_format = 'fallback' },
```

`lsp_format = 'fallback'` means a buffer with no entry in `formatters_by_ft` is still formatted by its
language server, if one is attached. To add a dedicated formatter for a filetype, add it to
`formatters_by_ft` (and to `extra_tools` in `lsp.lua` if it needs installing).

To turn it off — globally, per buffer, or per filetype — swap the table for a function; conform skips
the save-format when it returns `nil`:

```lua
format_on_save = function(bufnr)
  if vim.g.disable_autoformat or vim.b[bufnr].disable_autoformat then return end
  return { timeout_ms = 1000, lsp_format = 'fallback' }
end,
```

### Machine-Specific Settings
Put them in `lua/local.lua` — gitignored, copied from `lua/local.lua.example`, and loaded at the end of Section 1 so it overrides any default. See [Set Up This Machine](#3-set-up-this-machine) for what belongs there, and note that opt-in extras go in `lua/custom/plugins/` instead.

Whipsmart started as a fork of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and maintains its spirit of being a starting point rather than a distribution.
