# Whipsmart Architecture

Unified Neovim configuration for all machines.

## Core Philosophy

1.  **Universal Core:** Every machine runs the same core `init.lua` and `lua/plugins/*.lua`. LSP, completion, treesitter and formatting live here and are always loaded.
2.  **Opt-In Extras:** Heavier or situational features (`lua/whipsmart/plugins/*.lua` — debug, lint, markdown, neo-tree) are **not** loaded by default. A machine enables one by `require`-ing it from a file in `lua/custom/plugins/`.
3.  **Machine Overrides:** Machine-specific settings (colorscheme, UI toggles, Python path, custom keymaps) live in `lua/local.lua` (git-ignored), loaded at the end of Section 1 so it can override any default.
4.  **Lockfile Driven:** Plugins are declared by `vim.pack.add` calls in Lua; `nvim-pack-lock.json` is the source of truth for the **revision** each one sits at, and is written by Neovim itself.

## Adding a Plugin

The lockfile is **generated, never hand-edited**. Plugins are declared in Lua by calling
`vim.pack.add`, and `nvim-pack-lock.json` records the revision each one resolved to.

1.  Write the config, including its `vim.pack.add` call:
    - **Personal / machine-optional** — a new file in `lua/custom/plugins/`. Loaded automatically,
      no registration needed.
    - **Universal core** — a new file in `lua/plugins/`, then add its module name to the explicit
      loader list in `init.lua` (Section 2). Order matters there.
2.  Restart Neovim. `vim.pack.add` clones anything missing on the spot and asks you to confirm the
    install; there is no separate install command.
3.  Commit the resulting `nvim-pack-lock.json` change so the other machines pin the same revision.

```lua
-- lua/custom/plugins/harpoon.lua
vim.pack.add { 'https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon' }
require('harpoon').setup {}
```

Pin a version with a spec table instead of a bare URL — `{ src = ..., version = vim.version.range '2.*' }`
for a semver range, or `version = 'main'` for a branch. Pass an explicit `name` when the URL's last
path segment is generic. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for LSP servers, formatters, and treesitter
parsers, which have their own registration lists, and for how to remove a plugin again.

## Onboarding a Machine

Applies to any machine, new or being migrated. The goal is that all machine-specific logic lives
in `lua/local.lua` rather than in the tracked config — see the roster at the bottom for which
machines are done.

### Step 1: Clone and initialize local.lua
```bash
git clone https://github.com/4rc0s/whipsmart.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
cp ~/.config/nvim/lua/local.lua.example ~/.config/nvim/lua/local.lua
```

Then launch Neovim. Plugins listed in the lockfile but missing from disk are installed at their
locked revision on startup, after a confirmation prompt. Run `:checkhealth whipsmart` afterwards
to see which external tools and runtimes the machine is missing.

### Step 2: LSP — nothing to configure per machine
LSP is **not** configured per machine. Servers are declared centrally in `lua/plugins/lsp.lua`,
as one row per server in `lsp_servers` carrying both naming schemes — the lspconfig name (the
key, passed to `vim.lsp.config` / `vim.lsp.enable`) and the Mason registry name (the `mason`
field). The two often differ; the install list, runtime gate, opt-out filter and post-install
retry are all derived from that one row — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full procedure.

The core is also runtime-aware: each row's optional `runtime` key gates both installation and
activation, so a machine without Go never installs `gopls` and never tries to start it. Runtime
detection runs once at startup, so installing a new language needs a Neovim restart.

### Step 3: Low-Resource / ARM Optimization (Opt-Out)
The one per-machine LSP knob is opting **out**. For machines with limited resources (older
hardware, ARM devices), disable servers or tools the core would otherwise install:

```lua
-- lua/local.lua — disable heavy LSPs for performance
vim.g.disabled_lsp_servers = { 'lua_ls', 'stylua' }
```

This filters both the Mason install list and the `vim.lsp.enable` loop, so the server is neither
downloaded nor started on that machine. A server may be named either way — `lua_ls` or
`lua-language-server` both work, and both skip the download *and* the activation. Standalone
tools are named by their Mason package (`stylua`).

## Removed plugins clean themselves up (2026-10-06)

The old per-machine step for the catppuccin rename (`:lua vim.pack.del { 'nvim' }` on every
machine) is no longer needed. `lua/whipsmart/pack_removed.lua` lists plugins this config has
dropped — currently `nvim` (the pre-rename catppuccin clone) and `mason-lspconfig.nvim` — and
deletes any that are present and inactive at `VimEnter`. Each machine cleans itself up on its
first launch after pulling; expect one "Repaired corrupted lock data" warning followed by
"Removed plugin". The lockfile should show no diff afterwards.

`tokyonight.nvim` is now inactive on every machine (the colorscheme default
moved into `init.lua`). Leave it installed unless you want the disk back — see
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) under *Removing a plugin*.

## Status / Roadmap

- [x] Initial structure and Section 1-3 implementation.
- [x] Port core plugins (telescope, treesitter, etc.).
- [x] Implement `whipsmart.plugins` conditional loading.
- [x] Move per-machine overrides to `local.lua`.
- [x] Fix `local.lua` load order — `pcall(require, 'local')` moved to end of Section 1 so it can override defaults.
- [x] Add markdown opt-in extra (render-markdown, obsidian, blink.compat).
- [x] Migrate roci to whipsmart.
- [x] Migrate orca to whipsmart (machine-specific scrolloff and catppuccin in local.lua).
- [x] Migrate cygnus to whipsmart (machine-specific keymaps and plugins mainlined).
- [x] Unify Go configuration (Tabs, width 4) as a global standard in init.lua.
- [x] Unify Python configuration (Spaces, width 4, textwidth 88) in init.lua.
- [x] Migrate tau to whipsmart (create lua/local.lua).
- [ ] Migrate vera to whipsmart (create lua/local.lua).
- [ ] Add machine-specific UI toggles for terminal vs. GUI Neovim (via local.lua).
- [ ] Centralize snippet collections.
